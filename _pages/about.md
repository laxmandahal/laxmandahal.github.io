Hello World! I'm Laxman, a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.cee.ucla.edu/) and a second-year Masters student in the [Department of Statistics](http://statistics.ucla.edu/) at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am a natural hazard researcher and data scientist committed to make the world a safer place. My research work focuses on leveraging data-drive statistical and Machine Learning methods to quantify seismic risk and resilience of wood-frame buildings at a community scale. 

My aspirations to make a real impact has come to fruition in the form of my involvement at [Haselton Baker Risk Group](https://sp3risk.com/) as a Research Engineer Consultant. At HB Risk, I contribute to an array of projects including performing sensitivity analysis, implementing machine learning models to classify system types, and developing numerical models of buildings among others. 


## My work and research 

My research and work experiences are deeply rooted in application and development of state-of-the-art statistical methods in earthquake engineering. As a part of my Ph.D. research, I have developed an end-to-end Python-based computational tool to automate a suite of engineering steps involved in probabilistic performance-based earthquake engineering. The tool utilizes Object-Oriented Programming paradigm to modularize building design, numerical model development, nonlinear analysis, loss assessment and resilience quantification of wood-frame buildings. The idea behind creating an automated tool is mainly two folds: 1) being able to perform regional assessment on the fly, and 2) compile database of structural responses of the buildings to leverage ML/AI to develop computationally efficient predictive models. My ongoing research work aims to develop and implement advanced predictive models to bypass computationally expensive numerical simulation process. 


## Research interests

1. Application of ML/AI to solve complex problems such as quantifying seismic risk of a community.
1. Learn and interpret the data: causal inference.
1. Data analysis, sensitivity analysis, and optimization


## What's Next? 

As a fourth-year Ph.D. student, I often get asked, "Sooo, what are your future plans?" My answers is always the same. As much as I love research, I want to go into industry and harness (and test really) my data science skill sets. I would be fulfilled if I am in a position to contribute something to the fast evolving field of data science and ML/AI.



## Life outside work
If it wasn't for my commitment to being active, I would have long dropped out of my Ph.D. program. On weekends, I enjoy a nice hike, a bike ride in Marvin Braude Bike Trail along the Pacific Coast, a good weight lifting session, or a fun tennis game. Whatever it is, I am often outside (super grateful for the sunny LA weather).
