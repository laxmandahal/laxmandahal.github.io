## Abstract

Ten years in within the District, the District Department of Transportation has actively leveraged the use of performance pricing for the purposes of active curbside management to better encourage turnover, multimodal transportation use, preserving residential access, and reducing transportation network congestion. With prior limitations in technology and data analytical capacity, early performance pricing schemas in the District focused on zone-based pricing. With the precedence and capacity building stemming from the Penn Quarter/Chinatown Multimodal Value Pricing Pilot, DDOT has started to experiment with innovating performance pricing in the
Districtâ€™s Stadium Event Zone, centered around curbside management during stadium events. Home to both Nationals Park and Audi Field plus exponential land use
development, DDOT revamped zone-based pricing to progressive duration pricing at the start of the 2017 Washington Nationals baseball season. After two years of
operations, this analysis approach aims to determine the viability and effectiveness of operating an escalating, progressive duration pricing scheme in the District, especially centered around event-based pricing.
